## Version 3.1 (December 2020)

As of this release, osgEarth requires C++11.

GEOS: We transitioned from the GEOS C++ API to the C API for stability reasons. If you see GEOS compile/linker errors, this is likely the reason and you should make sure to link with the C library from now on. (GEOS is an optional dependency that enables some feature processing operations.)

Release Highlights:

- New ```TerrainConstraintLayer``` for masking and custom terrain tessellation. Please see ```constraints.earth``` for sample applications. This replaces and extends the old ```MaskLayer``` type.
- New ```LERCImageLayer``` (ESRI format)
- New ```ArcGISTilePackageElevationLayer```
- New ```ArcGISServerElevationLayer```
- New ```DebugImageLayer``` ```show_tessellation``` property to display the terrain mesh; handy for visualizing constraints created with the new ```TerrainConstraintLayer```
- Map-wide default texture compression setting allows you to enable automatic texture compression in the terrain options section of your earth file
- SONAME for Linux builds is now properly used. This was preventing ABI stability for some package managers.
- ```osgearth_conv``` supports a geocell index (```--index```) that can greatly increase the performance of a large tiling operation by implementing a gridded spatial index.
- New ```SelectExtentTool``` for drawing a bounding box on the map and firing a callback.
- XYZ layers now support the {-y} notation for Y inversion, a common notation used in web mapping URLs
- Write support for ```TMSElevationLayer```
- Improved task cancellation support throughout. Task cancellation occurs when the results of data-loading task are no longer required (because the camera moved) and we want to cut short the operation.
- Improved polygon tessellation (fixes various edge cases)
- Faster and better vector rasterization using the excellent ```Blend2D``` library (optional dependency)Transitioned to the GEOS C API for stability
- Improved parallelization for some drivers
- Mutex contention analysis in Tracy - helps us identify and mitigate contention to improve parallelization
- Normalized on C++11 threading primitives, almost completely removing the dependency on OpenThreads
- Various speed improvements and bug fixes
- Simplified CMake configuration process
- Support for GDAL 3.1 (mostly - see the spherical mercator note in SRS.cpp)
- Refreshed the documentation site
- GitHub actions for CI on Linux, Windows, and MacOS

## Version 2.6 (October 2014)

Maintenance Release. Release notes TBD.



## Version 2.5 (November 2013)

Terrain Engine

The terrain engine ("MP") has undergone many performance updates. We focused on geometry optimization and GL state optimization, bypassing some the OSG mechnisms and going straight to GL to make things as fast as possible.

MP has a new optional "incremental update" feature. By default, when you change the map model (add/remove layers etc.) osgEarth will rebuild the terrain in its entirely. With incremental update enabled, it will only rebuild tiles that are visible. Tiles not currently visible (like those at lower LODs) don't update until they actually become visible.

Caching

Caching got a couple improvements. The cache seeder (osgearth_cache) is now multi-threaded (as it the TMS packager utility). The filesystem cache also supports expiration policies for cached items, including map tiles.

JavaScript

We updated osgEarth to work with the newest Google V8 JavaScript interpreter API. We also now support JavaScriptCore as a JS interpreter for OSX/iOS devices (where V8 is not available).

Terrain Effects

A new TerrainEffect API makes it easy to add custom shaders to the terrain. osgEarth has several of these built in, including NormalMap, DetailTexture, LODBlending, and ContourMap.

New Drivers

There is a new Bing Maps driver. Bing requires an API key, which you can get at the Bing site.

We also added a new LibNOISE driver. It generates parametric noise that you can use as terrain elevation data, or to add fractal detail to existing terrain, or to generate noise patterns for detail texturing.

Other Goodies

- Shared Layers allow access multiple samplers from a custom shader
- A new "AUTO_SCALE" render bin scales geometry to the screen without using an AutoTransform node.
- PlaceNodes and LabelNodes now support localized occlusion culling.
- The Controls utility library works on iOS/GLES now.

osgEarth Sample

This map shows how to use the preemptive loading mode of osgearth. Preemptive
mode prioritizes the highest visible imagery LOD, skipping intermediate
levels. It also demonstrates per-layer resource allocation. Preemptive mode
uses a pool of loading threads to fetch tiles. You can use "loading_weight"
to give some layers more threads than others.

    <!-- loading_weight specifies the relative number of threads
         to use for this particular layer.  For heightfield layers,
         the highest specified loading_weight for all heightfield layers
         will be used.  For imagery layers, a separate group of threads
         will be allocated to handle each layer. -->

osgEarth Sample - Fractal detail

Uses the noise driver to add fractal detail to the terrain,
making it appear higher resolution than it really is.
This can be useful for presentation purposes when you don't
have very high resolution data.

	<!--
	Set the frequency to be the reciprocal of your elevation resolution.
	i.e., if your elevation data is 90m, set freq = 1/90. That will cause
	the noise function to cycle every 90m. This means you will only get
	noise between your real elevation values.
	
	Within that 90m span, the noise function will generate values between
	[0..scale]. So if the scale=10, you will get up to a +/-10m variation in
	elevation at each interpolated point eithin the 90m span.
	
	Octaves controls the recursion of this operation. The noise function will
	run once as normal, then again to further refine the results of the first
	output, and so on.
	
	With each succesive octave, the output is scaled like this:
	freq *= lacunarity, and scale *= persistence. This happens successivly for
	each octave.

# Locate gdal
# This module defines
# GDAL_LIBRARY
# GDAL_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to gdal 
# GDAL_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find the headers
#
# $GDALDIR is an environment variable that would
# correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$GDAL_DIR
# used in building gdal.
#
# Created by Eric Wing. I'm not a gdal user, but OpenSceneGraph uses it 
# for osgTerrain so I whipped this module together for completeness.
# I actually don't know the conventions or where files are typically
# placed in distros.
# Any real gdal users are encouraged to correct this (but please don't
# break the OS X framework stuff when doing so which is what usually seems 
# to happen).

# This makes the presumption that you are include gdal.h like
# #include "gdal.h"

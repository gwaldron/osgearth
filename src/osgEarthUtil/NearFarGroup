     * A NearFarGroup is a container for objects that should generate a
     * "self-contained" near/far clip plane calculation. The near/far clip
     * calculation for this group exists independently of the rest of the
     * scene graph.
     *
     * This is useful for creating more than one "depth domains" within the
     * scene. For example, if you have the globe in the background, but at the 
     * same time you want to zoom up very close to an aircraft, a combined
     * clip plane domain may not have sufficient precision. Placing the
     * aircraft under a NearFarGroup can help mitigate this problem.

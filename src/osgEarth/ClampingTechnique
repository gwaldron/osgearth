     * Clamps geometry to the terrain using the GPU.
     *
     * This overlay technique installs a shader that samples the depth
     * of the underlying terrain and then adjusts the vertex position to
     * the height of the terrain. It then applies a depth offset in order
     * to mitigate Z-fighting.
     *
     * Approach
     *
     * This technique works by first setting up a nadir-view RTT camera that
     * captures the depth component of the terrain within the view frustum of
     * the main camera. Then the GPU uses this "depth texture" to move each
     * vertex so it coindices with the terrain.
     *
     * Limitations
     *
     * Since this is an orthographic view, the effective resolution of depth
     * data close to the camera may not be quite sufficient, especially when
     * the camera is pitched up looking out over the horizon. As a reuslt, you
     * may see the verts "jitter" slightly in the Z direciton as you camera moves.
     *
     * Performance takes a hit since we need to RTT the terrain in a pre-render
     * pass.

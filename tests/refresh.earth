osgEarth Sample - Refresh

This example is a test of a dynamic image capability that refreshes an image every N seconds.  This doesn't really serve any purpose other than to serve
as a an example of how one might go about providing a dynamically refreshing image for a tile.

		You can also point to a local file, load it in an image editing program and save it and the new image will appear

     * Note: If you have any RTT cameras that deal with depth data,

     * Another Note: For this to work properly, sufficient tessellation
     * of objects very close to the camera is necessary. Huge polygons
     * that intersect the near plane are likely to be clipped in their
     * entirely. Increasing the tessellation can resolve that issue.

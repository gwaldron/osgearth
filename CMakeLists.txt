# Okay, here's the problem: On some platforms, linking against OpenThreads
# is not enough and explicit linking to the underlying thread library
# is also required (e.g. FreeBSD). But OpenThreads may be built with different
# backends (Pthreads, Sproc, Windows) so we don't know what the underlying
# thread library is because some platforms support multiple backends (e.g.
# IRIX supports Sproc and Pthreads). Linking all libraries won't work
# because the libraries may be incompatible.
# So the current solution is to attempt best guess linking and exempt certain
# cases. With IRIX, we're going to hope explicit linking to the underlying
# library is not necessary. We currently don't case for pthreads on Windows
# which might be an issue on things like Cygwin. This may need to be fixed.

# It is intended for those users who have common prefixes for their INCLUDE
# and LIBRARY locations. So if users have headers in /usr/local/include
# and libraries in /usr/local/lib, the common prefix is /usr/local.
# It should also cover the case where headers and libraries are
# in the same directory.
# Our proposal expects that FIND_* commands will automatically search for
# CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH right after CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH or CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH.
# Obviously, since CMake does not currently support this, we must write
# our Find*.cmake modules to explicitly support this. Otherwise, this variable
# will have no impact.
# This is unofficial so this may be removed or changed at anytime.
